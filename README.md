# dragn_hunter.py readme

command line code for searching for pairs of radio components that satisfy specified criteria, and flagging likely Double Radio sources associated with Active Galactic Nuclei (DRAGNs). Additionally candidate hosts are identified by querying the CatWISE2020 catalog using the flux weighted centroid of the double as the reference position. Run as:

    >python dragn_hunter.py radio_catalogue

where *radio_catalogue* is the filename of the radio catalogue data file. 

Additionally, there are a number of optional commands, these are [default values in square brackets]:\
*--config* [config.txt], config file describing the input component table (see below);\
*--find_hosts* [True], tell the code whether to query the AllWISE source catalog for potential host candidates;\
*--search_radius* [30arcsec], maximum radius to use when searching for radio cores (and AllWISE sources if *--find_hosts=True*);\
*--outdir* [output_files], directory in which to dump output files (will make directory if doesn't already exist).

A test input catalog has been provided in the directory _test_data_. This radio component data is a subset of the VLASS component catalog (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..255...30G/abstract) covering the region $100^{\circ} < \alpha < 200^{\circ}$ and $-5^{\circ} < \delta +5^{\circ}$.



## Output Data

The output of the code consists of a primary table (_dragns.fits_) and a number of suplementary tables described below. Note, the tables _sources.fits_ and _host_candidates.fits_ will only be produced if _--find_hosts_==True.

### Table of all identified pairs (pairs.fits)
This table describes the parent sample of 'pairs of candidate lobes' from which _dragns.fits_ is drawn. The table contains many of the columns from the input radio component catalog for each component identified as a canidate lobe or core (colname_1, colname_2, colname_c respectively). Additionaly some derived properties of the pairs are output with these column definitions below (some overlap with _dragns.fits_). These may be useful for refining _dragn_hunter.py_ for use on different data sets.
